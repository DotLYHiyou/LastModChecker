<h1>How this monstrosity works</h1>
<p>The part you are seeing is the actual interface, which holds all of the things you need to interact with LastModChecker.</p>
<p>Then, you have whats behind the interface, the backend, which handles what to do with the buttons and the input box. It also has the code to find the time the site was last modified.</p>
<p>A little deeper in the backend is the proxy, the purpose of it is to get around pesky CORS restrictions that stop LastModChecker from working.</p>
<p>Put it all together and you got LastModChecker!</p>
